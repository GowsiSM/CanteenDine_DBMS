🛒 Cart Management – Add or remove dishes from the cart with ease

📇 Place Orders – Provide basic user info like 👤 name and 📞 phone number at checkout

💳 Make Payment – Complete payment and store transaction details securely

📜 View History – Access transaction history for administrative purposes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **📦 Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fast-food-billing-system.git
cd fast-food-billing-system
```

2. **⚙️ Backend Setup (Flask)**
   Make sure Python is installed.

Run the Flask server:

```
python server.py
```

or

```
py server.py
```

This will start the backend on the default port (e.g., _http://localhost:5000_).

3. **🎨 Frontend Setup (React)**
   Navigate to the frontend directory:

```
cd frontend
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the frontend:

```
npm run dev
```

React app will run on _http://localhost:5173_ (or your default Vite port).

4. **🗃️ MongoDB Setup**
   Create a MongoDB database named:

#### canteen_dine

Create the following collections:
Dishes :

- Name (string)
- Description (string)
- Price (number)
- Image (string / image URL or encoded image)

Users :

- name (string)
- phone (string)
- Created at - timestamp

Orders :

- Cart details
- User details
- Transaction id
- Total amount

Transactions :

- User ID
- Payment details
- Payment method
- Payment status

<ins>Structure for dishes collection:</ins>

```
{
  "name": "Dish Name",
  "description": "A short description of the dish",
  "price": 100,
  "image": "image_url_or_filename"
}
```

Make sure your MongoDB is running and the connection string in your Flask app (server.py) points to your MongoDB instance.
